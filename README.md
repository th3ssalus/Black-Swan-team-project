**Summary:** Conducted analysis using Python to surface insights on customer churn trends and metrics for a telecommunication company dataset containing 7000 customer records. Worked as a team for one week to clean and analyse data using pandas and built logistic regression model with scikit-learn to predict existing customers at risk of churn. Insights and recommendations geared towards sales and marketing teams focusing on long term contracts, discounted family subscription plans, and eliminating electronic check as a payment method.

**Notes:**
The assignment: Swan Telecom (fictional) is a telecommunications company that has employed Black Swan (a team of analysts) to generate insights from their customer data.
They have requested two key deliverables:
  1. A working classification machine learning model, trained on the data they have supplied.
  2. A list of the top 500 customers most likely to churn.
The model should quantify customer churn risk and classify customers as "churners" (1) and "non-churners" (0).

Commits labelled with "Final Submission" are the deliverables that were sent to Swan Telecom from Black Swan (us).

This project evaluated the use of a random forest and a logistic regression model, both built using Python and the Scikit learn library.
When both were optimised it was found that our logistic regression model performed better than our random forest and therefore this model was submitted
to the client, alongside an information deck in the form of a powerpoint.
